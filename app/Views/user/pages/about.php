                        E-commerce businesses typically fall into one of four main groups, depending on their customers. Additional e-commerce business models exist, but they tend cater to specialized businesses and niches. Understanding the key differences between these models can be beneficial for organizations preparing to launch an e-commerce site.

                            The term “e-commerce” simply means the sale of goods or services on the internet. In its most basic form, e-commerce involves electronically transferring funds and data between 2 or more parties. This form of business has evolved quite a bit since its beginnings in the electronic data interchange of the 1960s and the inception of online shopping in the 1990s.
